## 📜 Description

This API provides endpoints to manage applications and their associated domain names. Each application can have multiple domain names, and each domain name has its own settings.  
  
**Features:**
- **Operations for Apps:** Create, read, update, and delete applications.
- **CRUD Operations for Domains:** Create, read, update, and delete domain names associated with applications.
- **Settings Management:** Retrieve settings for domain names by domain ID or domain name.
- **Event Dispatching:** A event should be dispatched to all other microservices to notify them of the new application.
